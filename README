Greasemonkey Scripts to enhance TheBrain Cloud Services Web Interface, see http://www.thebrain.com/products/cloud/ for product this is targeting.


Features
========

* Skins Cloud Brain interface in a dark theme
* Injects Iframe for website Url nodes in brain
* Adds menu system for utilities
* Hotkeys F3, PgDn, PgUp


Technical
=========

* Keeping css inside js
* Will do the same for images
* Some sites simply will not work or show in an Iframe, append ## to the url to block the Iframe from being created




Notes
=====

* This has not been tested with document or other links, it is designed for a Brain of pure Urls
* Such an example Brain can be found at http://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/753525E3-E419-E2C6-0496-028F1E10BC95
* Cloud Brains underlying code is in a state of flux, so this project has to keep up with changes
